LAST UPDATED: 24 November 2022

### ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
 This repository will contain all scripts necessary to reproduce output from the GutBrainGABA study. To make life easier,  scripts for structural, functional and spectroscopic analyses will be contained within separate folders. Each folder will contain its own README folder with instructions for use. Any scripts relating to all (or several) of these analyses will be contained within this parent folder.
 
##### N.B. This is work in progress - scripts *will* change over the next few months/years.
